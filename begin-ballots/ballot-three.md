# What should gov-begin do next?

gov-begin [voted](https://perl.topicbox.com/groups/gov-begin/T37ebbcbb89c74fc5/first-ballot-results-and-next-steps)
_"we should proceed to charter a governance body headed by an executive council of several people"_.

The following questions remain to be answered:

* what are the mandate and powers of the government being formed
* what is the shape of the larger group and executive council
* what are the rules for electing, aging out, and refilling seats
* what are the rules for changing the group's rules of operation
* what other rules of operation exist for the government's operation
* who are the initial members of the government
* do we agree to ratify the final result of all the above decisions?

Some participants have questioned this approach or have suggested
clarifying the process for decision making.  Others wish to proceed.

This vote will determine what gov-begin will do next.

---

**A:**  We will collect proposals for complete government constitutions and
        vote on those.

* We will have a period of two weeks in which to propose governments.  Anyone
  on the list may propose a constitution, and may amend their proposal at will.
  All proposals will be submitted by GitHub pull request, details to be
  determined.  Proposals are informed by but not bound by prior gov-begin votes.

* At the end of two weeks, the gov-begin moderator will call a vote to
  close discussion with a four-day voting period.  If this vote passes, the
  gov-begin moderator will take a snapshot of all proposals, publish them, and
  conduct a preferential ballot between them and a "none of the above" option,
  with a one week voting limit.

* If the vote to close discussion fails, the previous step will be repeated
  after two more weeks of discussion.

**B:**  We will conduct a series of ballots on the individual questions of
        governance to be answered.

* The gov-begin moderator will begin a series of votes to progress us through
  the questions above to iteratively design the council form of governance.

* Each ballot will answer one or more of the questions above, chosen and
  grouped at the gov-begin moderator's discretion.

* For each ballot, there will be a one week period to submit ballot options.
  Any option proposed and seconded by members of the list will be present.
  (The gov-begin moderator will provide strict rules to make clear how one
  alters their proposal.)

* Following the one week period to submit options, there will be a four day
  voting period.

* At the end of the series of decisions, we will proceed to gather and vote on
  whole-constitution proposals as described in option (A).

**C:**  We will collect proposals for rules of order for the gov-begin list
        discussions and vote for the rules under which we shall proceed. This
        process shall be conducted under the same terms as option A.  The
        rules of order will determine next steps for designing a government.

**D:**  We affirm our confidence in the current leadership and structure of the
        Perl project governance. The proceedings of the gov-begin list are
        concluded.

**E:**  I support none of the above options.
